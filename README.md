# Mondrian_art

Piet Mondrian's paintings are special due to their groundbreaking use of geometric abstraction, specifically his development of Neo-Plasticism. He reduced his visual vocabulary to simple, essential elements: primary colors (red, yellow, blue), black, white, and gray, and straight horizontal and vertical lines arranged in rectangular grids. This deliberate simplification was a radical departure from traditional art and aimed to express universal harmony and balance.
